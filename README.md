## Scraping Images from [Kemono](https://kemono.su/) Posts

This Python script allows you to download images from Kemono posts, using the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content of the page.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependency Installation

This script requires the following Python libraries:

- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup`

You can install these dependencies using the `pip` package manager. Execute the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` script.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using Python:

```
python main.py
```

4. When running the script, you will be prompted to enter an option to choose the language in which you want to execute the code.
5. After entering the desired language, the options will be displayed. Simply select the one that best suits your needs.

### Explaining the Options

In Kemono, it's common to find two types of posts: posts composed of images and text posts. This script offers the possibility to download both types of posts.

- To download a post composed of images, choose option number 1.
- To download a text post, choose option number 2.
- To download the text content and images from a post, choose option 3.

It's also possible to download all posts from a profile:

- If you want to download all image posts from a profile, select option number 4.
- If you prefer to download all text posts from a profile, choose option number 5.

Additionally, it's possible to download all direct messages (DMs) from a profile by selecting option number 6.
